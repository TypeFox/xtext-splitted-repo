<h2>Development Process</h2>
<p>Xtext follows the Eclipse Development Process (link!). In addition it joins the annual simultaneuos releases (since Galileo).</p>
<p>This means that we have a major release each year in June. Inbetween there are milestone releases (usually every six weeks), 
weekly integration builds and nightly builds.
</p>
<h3>Annual Simultaneous Release Meeting</h3>
<p>Once a year we do a meeting where we discuss the last release, the process, and what we want to do in the next release. 
This meeting is held face-to-face and usually takes place a couple of weeks after the last release.</p>
<p>The outcome of this meeting is:</p>
<ol>
  <li> A project plan (link!) for the upcoming simultaneous release.</li>
  <li> Updated information about processes and infrastructure. </li>
  <li> A wiki page containing the meeting minutes.</li>
  <li> A motivated and purposeful team :-) </li>
</ol>

<h3>The milestone meeting</h3>
<p>Each simultaneous release has seven milestones (every six weeks) and in the end there is a longer period for release candidates.</p>
<p>We do time boxed planning for each milestone. For that there is a face-to-face meeting we currently hold in the offices of itemis in Kiel, where most of the committers and the project lead live and work.</p>
<p>During that meeting we do a review of the last milestone and identify bugzillas we want to do in the upcoming milestone.</p>
<p>The outcome of this meeting is:</p>
<ol>
  <li> A list of bugzillas targeted at the next milestone.</li>
  <li> A wiki page containing the meeting minutes.</li>
</ol>
