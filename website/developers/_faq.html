<h2>[General] Main themes</h2>
<p>Xtext is designed along the mantra "We aim to make simple things
simple and complex things possible." from Alan Kay. This is not because
we're fans of Alan Kay but because the sentence pretty much nails it
down.</p>
<p>In addition to that we believe in the values defined in the <a
	href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" class="external text"
	title="http://agilemanifesto.org/" rel="nofollow">Agilo Manifesto</a>
and have some Xtext project specific extensions to that:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We value quality over quantity (That is while we like to have
	lots of cool features it is more important to have the things we
	already have in a good shape).</li>
</ol>

<h2>[General] Team philosophy</h2>
<p>The Xtext team works on a colaborative basis. This means that by
becoming a comitter you take responsibility not only for your own code
but for the whole project.</p>
<p><i>Code ownership is explicitly not desired!</i></p>
<p>You are allowed to do what ever you think is necessary to bring
the project closer to the main themes. Generally, this means that it is
important to get a feel for when things need to be discussed and when
you can do the changes without up-front discussion. When new to the team
it's best to watch how the others act in order to get that feel.</p>

<h2>[General] How does a development cycle usually look like?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure there is a corresponding bugzilla.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>It needs to be targeted at the next milestone.</li>
		<li>It needs to be unassigned.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Assign the bug to you.</li>
	<li>If it's a bug it is best to first write some tests reproducing the faulty behavior.</li>
	<li>Fix the problem / add the feature.</li>
	<li>Write some tests.</li>
	<li>Clean up your code (and other!).</li>
	<li>Write some tests.</li>
	<li>Add only good comments (mainly public API JavaDocs).</li>
	<li>Update the documentation (Documentation is maintained in project
	'org.eclipse.xtext.doc').</li>
	<li>Synchronize and Update</li>
	<li>Ensure all the tests are green. (Tests projects can be
	identified by their '*.tests' suffix. All tests have to be executed as
	plug-in unit tests.)</li>
	<li>Provide an informative commit comment. Add the URL to the bugzilla at the end of that comment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>[General] How to do the bootstrapping</h2>
<p>Xtext eats its own dogfood, i.e. the DSLs we use in Xtext are
designed with Xtext. In order to regenerate the infrastructure for the
Xtext grammar language, you need to run the generator from
'org.eclipse.xtext.bootstrap'. It uses a jared version of the Xtext
runtime.</p>
<p>We talk of bootstrapping when you recreate the jar (there's a
*.jardesc) with the latest code and then regenerate the grammar language
infrastructure using that newly created jar. It's best to do this twice
so that you're really sure that the code has been generated with the
same code which has been generated, which has been generated, which has
been generated...&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>Of course you'll have to run all tests to validate that the
bootstrapping was successful.</p>

<h2>[General] How to run the generators</h2>
<p>We have several samples and lots of test languages for which we
need to generate infrastructure code. If you've changed the generator
(org.eclipse.xtext.generator) somehow and check the generated code back
in (yes, we check the generated code in, due to too big challenges in
the build infrastructure).</p>
<p>Search the workspace for *.mwe files and you'll find one called
'GenerateAllLanguages.mwe'. Just run that workflow and all the language
infrastructures will be generated. If you need a new language for unit
testing, you should add it to the *.mwe file in the corresponding
project.</p>
<p>Note that the GenerateAllLanguages uses the code in the workspace
(not from the bootstrapped jar) to load the grammars and generate the
code. The Xtext grammar itself is not generated. To regenerate the Xtext
grammar see the previous section about bootstrapping.</p>

<h2>[UI programming] How do I get access to the model and the parse
tree?</h2>
<p>In the editor the model and parse tree is loaded and managed by
an implementation of IXtextDocument which extends IDocument. It is
important, that you refer to the parsed information in transactions
only. Therefore the IXtextDocument defines two methods:
readOnly(UnitOfWork&lt;T&gt;) and readWrite(UnitOfWork&lt;T&gt;).
Usually one only wants to read the parsed information in order to
compute completion proposals, build outline view, etc. To do so you have
to use the API like so:</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre> return document.readOnly(new UnitOfWork&lt;ICompletionProposal[]&gt;(){
   public ICompletionProposal[] exec(XtextResource resource) throws Exception {
     // compute proposals
     return proposals;
   }
 });
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p><b>It is very important that state from the passed resource
is never ever returned!</b></p>
