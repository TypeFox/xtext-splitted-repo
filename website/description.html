<font size="+1"><p><b><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext">Xtext (http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext) </a></b> is a framework for development of programming languages and
domain specific languages (DSLs). Just describe your very own DSL using
Xtext's simple EBNF grammar language and the generator will create a
parser, an AST-meta model (implemented in EMF) as well as a
full-featured Eclipse text editor from that.</p>
<p>The Framework integrates with technology from
Eclipse Modeling such as EMF, GMF, M2T and parts of EMFT. Development
with Xtext is optimized for short turn-arounds, so that adding new
features to an existing DSL is a matter of minutes. Still sophisticated
programming languages can be implemented.</p></font>
