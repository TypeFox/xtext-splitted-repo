<h1>Whats new in Xtext 2.3 BETA</h1>
<small>See what was new in the <a href="../2.2.0/new_and_noteworthy.php">previous release</a></small>
<p>Xtext 2.3 BETA offers a lot of new features and improvements. All in all, 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?list_id=944371;resolution=FIXED;classification=Modeling;chfieldto=2012-03-20;query_format=advanced;chfieldfrom=2011-12-15;component=Xtext;product=TMF">over 120 bug reports and feature requests</a> 
have been solved since Xtext 2.2. Please note that some the tickets may be related to <a href="http:/www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Eclipse Xtend</a>. Here is a summary of the most significant enhancements:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="entry_cell">Liberation of Xtend</td>
		<td>
		<p>
			The programming language <a href="http://eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a> moved to its own project under the 
			umbrella of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project.php?id=tools.xtend">eclipse.tools</a>.
		</p>
		</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="entry_cell">Debug Support</td>
		<td>
		<p>
			For DSLs from which Java code is being generated, Xtext now supports debugging as defined in JSR-045. All you need to do is define a 
			mapping between your DSL files and the generated Java code. Then, the Eclipse JDT debugger will be fully capable of debugging your 
			DSLs. The power of breakpoints, "step into", "step over", "step out" becomes available in your DSL!  
		</p>
		</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="entry_cell">Generated Source View</td>
		<td>
		<p>
			If you generate source code from your Xtext DSLs, it is now easy to implement a View for your workbench 
			that provides a preview of the how the generated code would look like.
		</p>
		</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="entry_cell">Hover Improvements</td>
		<td>
		<p>
			The new hover for Xbase based languages comes with a completely new HTML rendering for multiline comments
			of element declarations. Nearly all documentation annotations known from JDT are usable now. Even 
			generics are fully resolved when using generic typed methods.
		</p>
		</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="entry_cell">Xbase Compiler Improvements</td>
		<td>
		<p>
			To make the generated Java code even more readable, 
			the compiler can now inline certain operations. As a result the generated Java code is more idiomatic 
			and therefore more readable. Also some superfluous statements have been removed.
		</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="entry_cell">Xbase Number Literals</td>
		<td>
		<p>
			Fearless arithmetics with big numbers: Xtend now has comprehensive support for number literals. 
			This includes most of the things you can do in Java, and in addition it has first class support 
			for BigDecimal and BigInteger (including overloaded arithmetic operators).
		</p>
		<pre>
new BigDecimal("6.1").subtract(
       new BigDecimal("0.755").multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(3L)))</pre>
		<p>
			In Xtend you can use literals and operators :
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-xtend">6.1bd - 0.755bd * 3bd</pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
