How to Test the Website
-----------------------

The website is generated with Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com), which is based on Ruby.
If you already have Ruby, open a console and type

    $ gem install jekyll

If you don't have Ruby or Jekyll doesn't work with your current Ruby installation,
look for installation options on the Ruby website (https://www.ruby-lang.org).
The recommended way is to use RVM (https://rvm.io), which can be installed
with two console commands. Then you can install a new Ruby with

    $ rvm install 2.2.0

and install Jekyll as shown above. If Jekyll complains about wrong installed
versions of some other packages, install the requested version with

    $ gem install <package> -v <version>

To generate the website, point your console to the website project folder and type

    $ jekyll build

This will create a subfolder `_site` containing the complete website. You can test
it locally with the command

    $ jekyll serve

which will start a server displaying the generated site on the local host
(http://127.0.0.1:4000). The server also listens for file changes and
automatically rebuilds the website.
