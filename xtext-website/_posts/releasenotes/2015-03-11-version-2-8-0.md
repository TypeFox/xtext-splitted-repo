Version 2.8.0 comes with over 230 bugfixes and enhancements, the runtime performance as well as the tool performance has been improved significantly. The full bugzilla log can be found [here](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&f0=OP&f1=OP&f3=CP&f4=CP&j1=OR&list_id=11172029&query_format=advanced&status_whiteboard=v2.8&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr).

The following features have been added in particular.

## Whitespace-Aware Languages

Xtext 2.8 supports languages in which whitespace is used to specify the structure, e.g. using indentation to delimit code blocks as it is done in [Python](https://www.python.org). This is done through *synthetic tokens* defined in the grammar:

```xtext
terminal BEGIN: 'synthetic:BEGIN';
terminal END: 'synthetic:END';
```

These tokens can be used like other terminals in grammar rules:

```xtext
WhitespaceAwareBlock:
    BEGIN
        ...
    END;
```

The new example language *Home Automation* available in the Eclipse examples (*File &rarr; New &rarr; Example &rarr; Xtext Examples*) demonstrates this concept. It allows code like the following:

```ruleengine
Rule 'Report error' when Heater.error then
    var String report
    do
        Thread.sleep(500)
        report = HeaterDiagnostic.readError
    while (report == null)
    println(report)
```

More details are found in the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}documentation/307_special_languages.html#whitespace-aware-languages).

## Enhancements of the Grammar Editor

#### Configurable Severities
You can configure the severity (*ignore / warning / error*) of certain problems that are detected in a grammar file. Open *Xtext &rarr; Errors/Warnings* in the workspace preferences for global settings or in the project properties for project-specific settings.

#### Improved Content Assist
When you hit *Ctrl+Space* after the `with` keyword in a grammar definition, you get a list of available grammars which the currently edited grammar can inherit from.

## New Options for Code Generation

The *Generator* component supports two new options.

#### Class Annotations

You can specify annotations to be added to each generated class. With the following forkflow configuration, the annotation `@Generated` is added to each class:

```mwe2
Workflow {
  component = Generator {
      classAnnotation = GeneratedClassAnnotation {}
      ...
  }
}
```

You can also specify your own class annotations by implementing the interface *IClassAnnotation* and adding that implementation to the configuration.

#### File Header

Xtext generates Java files with the following file header comment:

```java
/*
 * generated by Xtext
 */
```

With Xtext 2.8, this can be configured in the workflow configuration with the *fileHeader* property of the *Generator* component.

```mwe2
var myFileHeader = "/*
 * My fancy file header
 * (c) \${year}
 */"

Workflow {
  component = Generator {
      fileHeader = myFileHeader
      ...
  }
}
```
