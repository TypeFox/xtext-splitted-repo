How to Test the Website
-----------------------

The website is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

To generate the website, run
```
  jekyll build
```
You will find the result in the `_site` folder. You can test it locally with
```
  jekyll serve
```
which will start a [server](http://127.0.0.1:4000) displaying the site. The server also listens for file changes and
automatically rebuilds the website.
