Version 2.8 got many new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements ([full bugzilla list](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&list_id=11217573&query_format=advanced&status_whiteboard=v2.8&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr)).

The most noteworthy changes are the following.

## Target Java Version

The new version of the Xtend compiler allows to configure the Java version level of generated code. The default setting is to use the same version as set for the source compatibility of the Java compiler (*Java &rarr; Compiler &rarr; Source compatibility*), which is in turn usually set to the same version as the *compiler compliance level*. The Xtend compiler settings can be configured in the *Compiler* preference page or project properties page.

By unchecking *Use language version from Java compiler source compatibility level*, you can choose to generate Java code with a different version than is set for the Java compiler. The actual changes in the generated code are described in the following.

### Java 5

Java 5 has been the default version level of the Xtend compiler from the beginning, so the generated code is the same as with earlier Xtend versions if you choose this target version.

### Java 6

When the Xtend compiler is set to at least Java 6, it generates an `@Override` annotation to each method that overrides a method from a superclass or implements an interface method.

### Java 7

Xtend expressions like `switch (obj) { ... }` where `obj` is of type [String]({{site.javadoc.java}}/java/lang/String.html) are translated to Java `switch` statements (see [Strings in switch Statements](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/strings-switch.html)).

In Xtend you can write number literals in the form `2_147_483_647` to enhance their readability. This is also [supported by Java 7](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/underscores-literals.html). When the Xtend compiler is set to at least Java 7, underscores in number literals are retained in the generated code.

### Java 8

[Xtend lambda expressions]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html#lambdas) like `[String s | s.toLowerCase]` are translated to [Java 8 lambda expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html), e.g. `(String s) -> return s.toLowerCase();`. More details on this translation are discussed in [this blog post](http://spoenemann.blogspot.de/2015/02/xtend-for-java-8.html).

Note that independently of which Java version is chosen for the generated code, Xtend works perfectly with the [lambda-optimized Java 8 API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/lambda_api_jdk8.html) because Xtend lambdas are fully compatible with Java 8 lambdas.

Xtend allows to define non-abstract methods (static or non-static) in interfaces when Java 8 is chosen as target language level. If such a method is non-static, it is translated to a [Java 8 default method](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html).

## More Compiler Options

You can now disable the automatic generation of `@SuppressWarnings` annotations for generated classes. Furthermore, you can enable the generation of `@Generated` annotations for all generated types, which can be useful for automatic processing of the source code, e.g. when you want to exclude generated types in code analysis tools. The annotation also allows to attach more information, which can be enabled in the preferences.

## Enhancements of the Xtend Editor

### Open Generated File

You can open the Java file that was generated from Xtend by right-clicking the Xtend editor and selecting *Open Generated File*.

### Open Inferred Type

You can open the declaration of the inferred type of a local variable by *Ctrl*-clicking (*Cmd* on Mac) the variable name. For example, a variable declaration like

```xtend
    val x = getValue()
```

does not show explicitly the type of `x`, but it is inferred from the return value of `getValue()`. The new feature allows to directly navigate to the inferred type.

### Improved Hover for Annotations

**TBD**

### Unique Class Name Validation

**TBD**

## Convert Java to Xtend

The new version features a Java-to-Xtend converter. Right-click a Java file in the Package Explorer and select *Convert to Xtend*. You can choose to keep the original Java file (though that will lead to errors due to duplicate types), and you are warned if the Java code contains parts that cannot be translated automatically. In this case the corresponding parts are marked with `FIXME` comments in the Xtend code. However, the converter is able to convert the majority of Java classes without problems.

## Active Annotations

#### Constant Field Initializer

*MutableFieldDeclaration* now features a set of methods like `setConstantValueAsInt(int value)` for creating static final fields with constant initializers. All primitive values as well as [String]({{site.javadoc.java}}/java/lang/String.html) are supported.

#### Default Methods

If the Xtend compiler is set to Java 8, you can create a method with default implementation in a Java interface by defining a method body and setting the *abstract* property to true for the *MutableMethodDeclaration*.

## Storable Resources (Provisional)

**TBD**
